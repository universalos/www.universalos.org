                        <h3>Hello! It's me, Universal OS!</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Universal OS stands for Universal Operating System.</p>
                        <p>An Universal OS is a software for everybody, everything and everywhere!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Why do we stand for UOS?</b></p>
                        <p>Because we believe there's only one way of making software, and it is making it for everything and everyone...
                        we also belive that hardware has a lot of ways of exist, but software only one because is the essence, the soul or the personality of a machine/device/computer.</p>
                        <p>That's because software only is a concept, as a beer is a concept but its content may differ, also cars, and everything. The OS must be also a concept, and it's variety may not
                        differ from versions, only by people: people must be fine with its software, OS, ourselves...</p>
                        <p>May not differ also, because when we doubt if using one or another OS, why to don't or to do use one or another, why there's not just 1 standarized software for all our devices...
                        then we have a problem: that's the present at 2020. We do not have an unique, stable and standarized software for everybody. But, we calcutate that in 2033, you'll probably have UOS.</p>
