			<h3>Hello! It's me, Universal OS!</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Universal OS stands for Universal Operating System.</p>
			<p>An Universal OS is a software for everybody, everything and everywhere!</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Why do we stand for UOS?</b></p>
			<p>Because we believe there's only one way of making software, and it is making it for everyone, on everywhere and for everything!</p>
			<p>We also belive that hardware has a lot of ways of exist, but software only one because is the essence, the personality, and/or the identity of a machine/device/computer.</p>
			<p>That's because software is not only a concept: as a car is a concept, as a keyboard is a concept and/or home is a concept. It is also physically located onto memory.</p>
			<p>The OS may not differ from versions, only by the way the people is: people must be relaxed with software, don't panic and understand it...</p>
			<p>When we doubt when to use (one actual OS) or not, where to or where not to, why or why not, we have a feeling of human rights, but a reality of impossibility yet.</p>
			<p>That's the situation in 2020, and it's a problem because we do not have an unique, stable and standarized software to satistfy our needs.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Moneytizing, contributing and distributing UOS</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Actually we do not have a income of money, and that's a problem on the point of view of some people (for this huge project).</p>
			<p>We are group of people in Telegram, whom have a github account (with more than 3 repos) and can pay this domain to host this...</p>
			<p>But we need your help (everyone).</p>
			<p>Actually this is just a project. Curated with a lot of love, patience and friendship.</p>
			<p>But we are sure that we can make something good for everyone, with our time, skills and/or resources.</p>
