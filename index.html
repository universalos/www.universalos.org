			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Universal OS stands for Universal Operating System.</p>
			<p>An Universal OS is a software for everybody, everything and everywhere!</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><b><a id="uos_philosophy">Why do we stand for UOS?</a></b></p>
			<p>Because we believe there's only one way of making software, and it is making it for everyone, on everywhere and for everything!</p>
			<p>We also belive that hardware has a lot of ways of exist, but software only one because is the essence, the personality, and/or the identity of a machine/device/computer.</p>
			<p>That's because software is not only a concept: as a car is a concept, as a keyboard is a concept and/or home is a concept. It is also physically located onto memory.</p>
			<p>The OS may not differ from versions, only by the way the people is: people must be relaxed with software, don't panic and understand it...</p>
			<p>When we doubt when to use (one actual OS) or not, where to or where not to, why or why not, we have a feeling of human rights, but a reality of impossibility yet.</p>
			<p>That's the situation in 2020, and it's a problem because we do not have an unique, stable and standarized software to satistfy our needs.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><b><a id="contributing_to_uos">Moneytizing, contributing and distributing UOS</a></b></p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Actually we do not have a income of money, and that's a problem on the point of view of some people (for this huge project).</p>
			<p>We are a group of people in Telegram, whom have a github account (with more than 3 repos) and can pay this domain to host this, at the momment.</p>
			<p>Do you want to help us?</p>
			<p>Actually this is just a project, curated with a lot of love, patience and friendship.</p>
			<p>And we are sure that we can make something good for the world, with our time, skills and/or resources; but together.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><b><a id="uos_kernel_description">The UOS Kernel</a></b></p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>The UOS Kernel is an exokernel; (I speak about virtually what will be); It is an exokernel that will implement different layers, functionalities and features.</p>
			<p>Those features are always chosen by the user, the owner or the ghost in the shell (;). I mean, I can not be sure our kernel will be unbreachable, what I can
			ensure is that it will be a kernel with support for every hardware, because we will implement support for loading drivers from the three most known OSs.</p>
			<p>Because a system for everybody, is also a system for every hardware... and speaking about software, we can not be sure about the security of a software which
			is done under a predeterminated and not maybe choosen hardware. I am speaking about the implication of the hardware architecture onto the resulto of unsafe software.</p>
			Like when you go hunting, and there's an accident, it probably was an accident, but it happened. The same with all my concepts of UOS, can be perfectly not perfect.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Even not being everything perfect, our kernel stands for chasing for the excelence, because then success will follow... because, we are doing this curated with love.</p>
			<p>I do this for myself, and I am sure my team also does for theirselves; not hoping anything else than we can offer from each others, because we really believe in our skills,
			we are conscients of our needs and we are professionals (doing this on our free time).</p>
			<p>So the kernel of UOS is an exokernel, and it will be just like a semaphore between hardware and drivers, and it will be simple and small but strong.</p>
			<p>I leave this section with an image, because an image says more than thousands of words:</p>
