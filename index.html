			<h3>Hello! It's me, Universal OS!</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Universal OS stands for Universal Operating System.</p>
			<p>An Universal OS is a software for everybody, everything and everywhere!</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Why do we stand for UOS?</b></p>
			<p>Because we believe there's only one way of making software, and it is making it for everyone, on everywhere and for everything!</p>
			<p>We also belive that hardware has a lot of ways of exist, but software only one because is the essence, the personality, and/or the identity of a machine/device/computer.</p>
			<p>That's because software is not only a concept: as a car is a concept, as a keyboard is a concept and/or home is a concept. It is also physically located onto memory.</p>
			<p>The OS may not differ from versions, only by the way the people is: people must be relaxed with software, don't panic and understand it...</p>
			<p>When we doubt when to use or not, one actual OS, where to or where not to, why or why don't, we have a feelling of right, but a reality of not possible yet.</p>
			<p>That's the way in 2020, and we have a trouble because we do not have an unique, stable and standarized software for everything.</p>
			<p>Luckily, we calcutate that maybe, near of 2033, we'll probably have a beta of <b>UOS</b>.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>Contributing, monetizing and distributing <b>UOS</b></h3>
			<p>Well, actually, we are group in Telegram, we have a github account with repos, we can pay this domain and host it... but we need the help of everyone whom can help.</p>
			<p>Actually this is just a project, not a company, not a business, just (maybe) a dream.</p>
			<p>But we are sure that we can make something good for everybody, with our free time, that probably once again is going to change the course of our lifes.</p>
