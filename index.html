			<h3>Hello! It's me, Universal OS!</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Universal OS stands for Universal Operating System.</p>
			<p>An Universal OS is a software for everybody, everything and everywhere!</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Why do we stand for UOS?</b></p>
			<p>Because we believe there's only one way of making software, and it is making it for everyone, on everywhere and for everything!</p>
			<p>We also belive that hardware has a lot of ways of exist, but software only one because is the essence, the personality, and/or the identity of a machine/device/computer.</p>
			<p>That's because software is a concept: as a car is a concept, as a keyboard is a concept and/or home is a concept.</p>
			<p>The OS must be also a concept, and that concept may not differ from versions, only by people: people must be fine with theirselves, ourselves and software...</p>
			<p>May not differ also, because when we doubt if using one or another OS, where to or where not to, why to don't or to use one or another, we have the right to have an OS for everything, everywhere and everyone.</p>
			<p>But it isn't that way in 2020, and then we have a problem because we do not have an unique, stable and standarized software for everybody.</p>
			<p>Luckily, we calcutate that in 2033, you'll probably have <b>UOS</b>.</p>
